# Cicero Aware

Cicero Aware is the trade name for the independent software engineering and consultancy activities of [@yukawa](https://github.com/yukawa) (**Yohei Yukawa**).

This organization primarily serves as a workspace for open-source contributions, focusing on text input technologies, internationalization (i18n), and low-level systems programming. While Cicero Aware operates as a sole proprietorship based in Kyoto, Japan, its core mission in this organization is to sustain and improve critical open-source infrastructure.
